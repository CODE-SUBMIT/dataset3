# Overview
This repository contains a dataset of indoor furniture layouts together with an end-to-end rendering image of the interior layout. This layout data is from designers at the real selling end.There are 60 professional designers who work with an industry-lever virtual tool to produce a variety of designs. Among these designs, part of them are sold to the proprietors for their interior decorations. We collect these designs at the selling end and provide 710,700 interior layouts. Each sample of the layout has the following representation including the categories of the furniture in one room, the position (x,y) and size (height, width, length) of each furniture, the position (x,y) and size (height, width, length) of the doors, windows, and walls in the room.
