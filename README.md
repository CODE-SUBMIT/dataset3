# End-to-end Generative Floor-plan and Layout with Attributes and Relation Graph (E2EFPL)

## Overview
This repository contains a dataset of indoor furniture layouts together with an end-to-end rendering image of the interior layout. This layout data is from designers at the real selling end. There are 60 professional designers who work with an industry-lever virtual tool to produce a variety of designs. Among these designs, many of them are sold to the proprietors for their interior decorations. We collect these designs at the selling end and provide 191,208 interior layouts. 

Each layout sample contains the categories of furniture in a room, the position (x,y) of each furniture, the size (length, width, height) of each furniture, the position (x,y) of the doors and windows in the room, and the position (x,y) of each fragment of the walls, and the dimensional category of each room. The dataset contains 3 main categories of rooms and 14 subcategories (dimensional category) of rooms.
